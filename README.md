# Computer Vision repository
There is a repository that I use to upload some codes of my Computer Vision learning. They are rather simple and mostly rewrited from other sourcec, but there are also some changes made by me.

  .xml files are needed to be add to the path before running a code. They contain the pre-trained models of OpenCV library such as FaceDetection and so on
